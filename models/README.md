# Machine Learning Models

This directory contains the implementation of machine learning models for traffic prediction.

## Models to Implement

- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**: `lstm_model.py`
- **GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)**: `gru_model.py`
- **Custom Model**: `custom_model.py`

## Model Evaluation

The `evaluation.py` file will contain code for evaluating and comparing the performance of different models.

## Usage

Models will be trained using the processed data from `data/processed/sequence_data.npz`.
