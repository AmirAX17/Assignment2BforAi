# Boroondara Traffic Network: LSTM Model Evaluation
# Scenario: Evaluating the LSTM model's ability to predict traffic flow at key Boroondara intersections
test_name=Test Case 10

# Model Description:
# The LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model is trained on historical traffic data from the Boroondara area
# It predicts traffic flow values based on previous time steps of traffic data
# This test evaluates its performance on unseen test data

# Test Parameters:
# - Using 20 samples from test dataset
# - Evaluating metrics: MSE, RMSE, MAE
# - Testing prediction accuracy during peak hours
# - Evaluating at SCATS sites: 2000, 3812, 4035, 4043, 4321

# SCATS Sites for Evaluation:
# 2000: TOORAK_RD W of WARRIGAL_RD/060 H06    # Major eastern intersection with heavy traffic flow
# 3812: CAMBERWELL_RD NW of TRAFALGAR_RD/059 K02  # Commercial hub with shopping centers
# 4035: TOORAK_RD W of BURKE_RD/045 H08       # Busy intersection with tram interchange
# 4043: TOORAK_RD W of GLENFERRIE_RD/045 H06  # Retail and restaurant precinct
# 4321: TOORAK_RD W of AUBURN_RD/045 H05      # Residential area with moderate traffic

model=lstm        # Using LSTM model for traffic prediction
num_samples=20    # Number of test samples to evaluate
